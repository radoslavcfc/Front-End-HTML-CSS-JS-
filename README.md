HTML, CSS and Javascript + JQuery in use for this little app.
It generates a diagram with 20 points linked with lines. 
The Y dimension of each point is randomly generated and limited in the SVG window dimensions.
I used the HTML based SVG technique.
You can change the colors of the lines and the circles after the diagram has been generated.
There is an option in the code to change these colors before the actual generate process - please read the comment in the code.
If you click on one of the points you can change the Y value of the selected point.
