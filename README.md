HTML, CSS and Javascript + JQuery in use for this web app.
It generates a vector-based graphic with 20 points linked with lines. 
The Y dimension of each point is randomly generated and limited within the SVG window dimensions (500px X 300px).
For drawing the diagram I have used the SVG extension of HTML.
The user can change the colors of the lines and the circles after selecting the new new colors and press the button underneath.
By clicking on one of the points the user can change the "Y" value of the selected point by filling up the form.
